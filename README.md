Recon-HUD-Paragliding
=====================

A recon app for paraglider pilots. 

[Recon](http://reconinstruments.com) is a small display placed in a corner of your vision, which makes it sort of a Head-Up Display. 

This is very experimental. Currently implemented features: 

* Receive status from Recon device
* Display basic information on screen: Altitude, Variance, Speed, Time of Day.

* Can also connect to a [FlyNet bluetooth variometer](http://www.asinstrument.ch/pages/flynet2-vario), receive pressure data and discard it. 


Plans 
=====

* Connect to a mobile phone running gaggle
* Serve as pressure / variance data source for the [Gaggle app](https://github.com/geeksville/Gaggle)
* Receive and display gaggle data on screen
